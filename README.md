# **HandSpeak - Sign Language App**

![HandSpeak Banner](Preview.png)

**HandSpeak** is a capstone project developed as part of the **Bangkit Academy 2024** graduation requirement. This application leverages **Machine Learning** and **Computer Vision** to recognize and translate alphabet-based sign language (A‚ÄìZ) into text using uploaded images. Designed with inclusivity in mind, HandSpeak aims to bridge communication gaps for individuals with speech impairments.

## üîç Project Summary

> The development of a sign language detection application is a significant advancement in technology that aims to assist non-speaking individuals in communicating.

The **HandSpeak App** is designed to:
- Detect and interpret sign language gestures from A to Z.
- Translate gestures into corresponding letters using a custom-trained machine learning model.
- Enable inclusive communication between those who use sign language and those who do not understand it.

This innovation promotes accessibility, inclusivity, and independence for users in educational, social, and caregiving environments.
